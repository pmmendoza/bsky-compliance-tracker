# Compliance Tracker

This directory contains tooling used to collect engagement and feed-retrieval compliance data for the Newsflows Bluesky bots.

## Overview
- `collect_engagements.py` is a thin wrapper around the `compliance_tracker` package. The package splits responsibilities into modules for API calls, SQLite storage, repair routines, hydration utilities, and the CLI entrypoint.
- `compliance_tracker/cli.py` resolves each bot handle in `BOT_HANDLES`, fetches recent posts, and records likes, reposts, replies, and quotes into the shared SQLite database `compliance.db`. At the end of every run the CLI hydrates newly observed feed payload posts into the `posts` table.
- Every engagement row stores whether the engaging DID was part of the subscriber list at collection time (`is_subscriber`), so activity from all accounts is retained with the relevant context.
- Comment and quote engagements capture the text that was posted, stored alongside the engagement metadata for auditability.
- Feed generator compliance events (feed retrievals) are persisted in the same database, enabling joins between engagements and feed requests on requester/engager DIDs.
- Subscriber snapshots are change-driven: repeated checks update `last_checked_ts` on the current state and only add a new row when the endpoint returns different data.
- The collector appends JSON lines to `db_update_log.jsonl` whenever it writes to the database for traceability.
- `finalize_schema.py` can be executed once to back up the on-disk database and ensure all columns/indexes are present. Fresh runs of the CLI also verify the schema, but the helper is convenient for migrating historic files.

## Engagement Collection Flow
1. Load environment variables from `compliance-tracker/.env` (fallback to `blueskyranker/blueskyranker/.env`). Requires `FEEDGEN_LISTENHOST` and `PRIORITIZE_API_KEY`.
2. Query the feed generator `/api/subscribers` endpoint to enumerate subscriber DIDs and handles.
3. Resolve each Newsflows bot handle to a DID via the Bluesky AppView API and fetch posts newer than the requested window. When `--days` is omitted, the collector automatically resumes from the most recent engagement stored in `compliance.db`.
4. For each post, retrieve likes, reposts, replies (via thread traversal), and quotes. All engagements are recorded; the `is_subscriber` flag indicates whether the actor was in the subscriber set when collected.
5. Persist engagements with uniqueness on `(timestamp, did_engagement, post_uri, engagement_type)`.

## Feed Retrieval Compliance
- When `--skip-feed` is omitted, the collector calls the feed generator `/api/compliance` endpoint for the requested window (`--feed-days` override) and optional requester DID filter (`--feed-did`).
- Feed requests are stored in `feed_requests`; individual posts returned to each requester are stored in `feed_request_posts`.
- Foreign key constraints ensure post rows are removed when their parent request is replaced.

## Environment Configuration
Provide a `.env` file in this directory with at least:
```
FEEDGEN_LISTENHOST=<host or https://domain for feed generator>
PRIORITIZE_API_KEY=<api key for subscriber/compliance endpoints>
```
The script will also respect the same variables already present in the process environment.

## Running the Collector
Install dependencies (`requests`, `pytest`, and optionally `tqdm`) in your Python environment, then run for example:
```
python collect_engagements.py --days 2 --db compliance.db
```
Key CLI options:
- `--days`: Engagement lookback window (fractional days allowed). If omitted, the collector resumes where the last engagement run left off.
- `--since`: Absolute timestamp (UTC) or numeric days-ago offset for the engagement window, overriding `--days`.
- `--db`: Path to the unified compliance SQLite database.
- `--log-level`: Logging verbosity (`INFO` default).
- `--timeout` / `--max-retries`: HTTP resilience tuning.
- `--skip-likes`, `--skip-reposts`, `--skip-comments`, `--skip-quotes`: Disable specific engagement types.
- `--feed-days`, `--feed-did`, `--skip-feed`: Control feed compliance collection. Without `--feed-days`, the collector resumes from the latest stored feed retrieval.
- `--feed-since`: Absolute timestamp or numeric offset for feed retrieval backfills, overriding `--feed-days`.
- `--post-repair-window`: Look back this many days for feed snapshots that came back empty and retry fetching their payloads.
- `--position-days` / `--position-since`: Force re-evaluation of subscriber post positions for the supplied window (accepts ISO timestamps or numeric offsets), independent of the engagement lookback.
Run `python compliance-tracker/collect_engagements.py --help` for the full list.

The CLI emits progress bars (via `tqdm` when available) for bot processing, feed retrieval ingestion, and post hydration batches.

## Logging
- `db_update_log.jsonl` contains a JSON entry per database write recording the table, counts, and affected identifiers.
- At startup the collector logs the latest engagement and feed-retrieval timestamps (including days since) and, when more than four days of data would be fetched or no history exists, asks for confirmation before proceeding.

## Follower tracking
- Latest follower counts per subscriber DID:
  ```sql
  SELECT did, following_count
  FROM subscriber_follow_counts
  WHERE (did, snapshot_ts) IN (
      SELECT did, MAX(snapshot_ts)
      FROM subscriber_follow_counts
      GROUP BY did
  )
  ORDER BY following_count DESC;
  ```
- To inspect history for a specific subscriber, run `./follower_history.py --did <DID>` (defaults to the project `compliance.db`). Rows only advance when the subscriber state changes; otherwise `last_checked_ts` is extended in place.
- API prerequisites: the follower fetcher requires `FEEDGEN_LISTENHOST` and `PRIORITIZE_API_KEY` to be present in the environment or `.env` file; the collector enforces a 0.2â€¯s pause between profile requests to stay within the public Bluesky rate limit (~3,000 calls / 5 minutes).
- The collector prints progress bars using `tqdm` when available, otherwise falls back to a stderr progress indicator.
- SQLite files and the log file are created automatically; ensure the process has write access to this directory.
- Failures to reach APIs or decode JSON raise descriptive errors after retry backoff controlled by the CLI flags.
- During each run the CLI resolves the bot DIDs and logs the associated PDS host, aiding troubleshooting when a bot migrates to a different provider.
- After each run the CLI reports how many subscriber engagements received a post position, how many did not, the breakdown of reasons, and the average delay between feed retrieval and engagement. The same payload is appended to `db_update_log.jsonl` under the `engagement_positions` table key.
- Feed payloads with missing posts are automatically retried for the configured repair window. Repair statistics are logged to stdout and the update log.

## Maintenance Scripts
- `hydrate_posts.py` seeds the `posts` table from historical payloads and hydrates any URIs still marked `pending` or `error`.
- `backfill_post_indices.py` recalculates `feed_request_posts.post_index` from stored JSON snapshotsâ€”useful after a feed bug is fixed.
- `follower_history.py` prints the latest follower counts per DID or the full change history for a single subscriber.

## Tests

Unit tests live under `tests/` and cover feed storage, post-position matching, repair routines, and utility helpers. Execute them with:
```
pytest
```
All tests operate on in-memory SQLite databases and do not require network access.

Connect to `compliance.db` with `sqlite3` (or your preferred client) and adjust the placeholders before running these queries.
